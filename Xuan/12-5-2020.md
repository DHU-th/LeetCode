## 1. _LeetCode 23_ Merge k Sorted List ##

### **Description:** ###

Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

**Example:**

```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

### **Approach 1:** ###

Insprired by _LeetCode 21_ [Merge Two Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/ "21. Merge Two Sorted Lists"), we can initialize a virtual list `=None`, merge each list and update the result iteratively.
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[ListNode]) -> ListNode:
        result = None
        for a_list in lists:
            result = self.mergeTwoLists(result, a_list)
        
        return result
        
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        head = ListNode(0)
        curr = head
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                curr.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                curr.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            curr = curr.next
        
        curr.next = l1 if l1 else l2
        return head.next
```

However, this approach is very time-consuming. Assume that the longest linked list is $n$-length, after one merge, the length of result would be $n$; after &i& merges, it jumps to $i \times n$. $i$-th merge costs $O(n+(i-1) \times n)=O(n)$. We need $O(\sum_{i=1}^k i \times n)=O(k^2 n)$ time to complete.

### **Approach 2: ** ###

Consider an optimized version of _Approach 1_, we can **pair**, or match $k$ lists, dividing them into $\freq {k} {2}$ groups, $\freq {k} {4}$ groups, ...

```python
def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[ListNode]) -> ListNode:
    return self._mergeKLists(lists, 0, len(lists) - 1)
    
def _mergeKLists(self, lists: List[ListNode], low: int, high: int) -> ListNode:
    if low > high:
        return None
    elif low == high:
        return lists[low]
    else:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        return self.mergeTwoLists(self._mergeKLists(lists, low, mid), self._mergeKLists(lists, mid + 1, high))
 ```
 
`mergeTwoLists` method remains the same. We make tremendous progress through this optimization! Execute time has reduced rapidly from 4960 ms to 92 ms (Two submission records on LeetCode.)

Time Complexity: $O(kn \times \log k)$

Space Complexity: $O(\log k)$

### **Approach 3: ** ###

Consider that we need to maintain the first nodes of $k$ lists. The minimal element should be selected and merged into specific linked list. Priority queue is suitable for this problem.
