### **Description:** ###

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**

You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given

```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```

Return the following binary tree:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

### **Solution:** ###

  We do it recursively. 
  
  The preorder traversal of a binary tree is: ROOT NODE, LEFT SUBTREE, RIGHT SUBTREE;
  
  The inorder traversal of a binary tree is: LEFT SUBTREE, ROOT NODE, RIGHT SUBTREE.
  
  First node traversed by preorder procedure is ALWAYS the `root` node. All nodes reside on its left subtree would be visited before that node in `inorder` list. So does right subtree (after). Thus, it is easy to know the numbers of nodes of left subtree and right subtree. 
  
  Due to the independence of traversal method and the amount of nodes, we can figure out the boundary of left subtree and right subtree in `preorder` list by the amount of sub-nodes calculated above. Furthermore, we can get the pre- and in-order traversal of these subtrees. Do it recursively, reconstruct its left and right subtree, and reconstruct the whole binary tree in the end.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        if not preorder:
            return None
        
        indexDict = {}
        for i in range(len(inorder)):
            indexDict[inorder[i]] = i
        
        return self._buildTree(preorder, 0, len(preorder) - 1, inorder, 0, len(inorder) - 1, indexDict)
        
    def _buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], preorderStart: int, preorderEnd: int,
                  inorder: List[int], inorderStart: int, inorderEnd: int, indexDict: dict) -> TreeNode:
        if preorderStart > preorderEnd:
            return None
        
        # find the root node
        rootVal = preorder[preorderStart]
        root = TreeNode(rootVal)
        
        if preorderStart == preorderEnd:
            return root
        else:
            indexAtInorder = indexDict[rootVal]
            leftTreeSize = indexAtInorder - inorderStart
            rightTreeSize = inorderEnd - indexAtInorder
            
            leftTree = self._buildTree(preorder, preorderStart + 1, preorderStart + leftTreeSize, 
                                      inorder, inorderStart, indexAtInorder - 1, indexDict)
            rightTree = self._buildTree(preorder, preorderEnd - rightTreeSize + 1, preorderEnd,
                                       inorder, indexAtInorder + 1, inorderEnd, indexDict)
            
            root.left = leftTree
            root.right = rightTree
            return root
  ```

Time Complexity: $ O(n) $, all nodes reconstruction

Space Complexty: $ O(n) $, space for storing the tree

## 2. _LeetCode 535_ Encode and Decode TinyURL ##

Hyperlink: https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/

中文版：https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/

### **Description:** ###

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

```python
# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.decode(codec.encode(url))
```

### **Approach 1: Simple Count** ###

Difine a counter `cnt` in order to encode URLs, and `cnt` itself increments by 1 when a new URL comes.

```python
class Codec:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mapping = {}
        self.cnt = 1
        
    def encode(self, longUrl: str) -> str:
        """Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
        """
        self.mapping[self.cnt] = longUrl
        self.cnt += 1
        return 'http://tinyurl.com/' + str(self.cnt - 1)

    def decode(self, shortUrl: str) -> str:
        """Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
        """
        return self.mapping[int(shortUrl.replace('http://tinyurl.com/', ''))]
  ```
  
  *Performance Analysis:*
  1. Encryptable URLs rely on the scope of `int` (not a big problem in Python). Overflow will invalidate the originally encrypted website as well as this algorithm itself;
  
  2. The length of `shortUrl` could not always be shorter than `longUrl`;
  
  3. Too simple. Easy to be cracked.
  
  _**For the sake of clarity, we implement `encode` method only from Approach 2. You need to find `decode` method and the constructor to run the algorithm.**_
  
  ### **Approach 2: Encryption by Order** ###
  
  See this order as a 62-base system, and map each 'bit' into a map, which contains 10 digits and 26\*2=52 letters, as its hash value.
  
  ```python
    def getKey(self) -> str:
        chars = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        key = ''
        
        i = self.cnt
        self.cnt += 1
        
        while i > 0:
            i -= 1
            key += chars[i % 62]
            i /= 62
            
        return key
    
    def encode(self, longUrl: str) -> str:
        key = self.getKey()
        self.mapping[key] = longUrl
        return 'http://tinyurl.com/' + key
  ```
  
  ### **Approach 3: Random Integer** ###
  
  In this approach we generate an integer key randomly. Implement Approach 3 in Java.
  
  ```java
    public String encode(String longUrl) {
        Random random = new Random();
        int key = random.nextInt(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        while (map.contains(key)) {
            key = random.nextInt(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        map.put(key, longUrl);
        return "http://tinyurl.com/" + key;
    }
  ```
  
   ### **Other Approaches:** ###
   
   Some languages provide built-in methods, like `hashCode()` in Java, could be a good way for encryption. And like the idea in Description part, we can use a fixed-size suffix to make URLs shorter.
